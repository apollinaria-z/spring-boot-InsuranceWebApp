# spring-boot-InsuranceWebApp

To compile an application make following steps:
1) use postgreSQL database
2) pay attention on postgersql user and password in file application.properties
3) create database with name "insurancedb"

Run application using class ApollinariaInsuranceApplication.java

On the main page http://localhost:8080 there are references for clients and policies with theirs own functionality.
Clients branch shows the list of clients and ability to add new client in database.
Policy branch is unfinished but created for same functions as you can see in code.

I also have common application in Spring-MVC. 
It is here https://github.com/apollinaria-z/SpringMVC-InsuranceWebApp .
This variant of Insurance application perform crud-operations with database of clients and policies.
